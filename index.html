winnie is an IRC bot. She sits and waits for people to make statements, "this car is fast," "you are a fatass," "I have a rash." Everything that gets said over the period in which she observes a channel is recorded. Meticulously. Using the natural language processing toolkit ^1, she can analyse english on a really, really mediocre level.
